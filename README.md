# AUTOINLAND_INSURANCE_CHALLENGE_6th_position


The objective of this hackathon is to develop a predictive model that determines if a customer will submit a vehicle insurance claim in the next three months.

This solution will help streamline financial planning at AutoInland and allow them to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are likely 

to submit a claim.
